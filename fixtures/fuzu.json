The project aims to produce and test a methodology for the participatory assessment and monitoring of land degradation in pastoral areas. The project has two overall objective, i) to strengthen the capacity of local and national stakeholders in pastoral areas comprising of grasslands and rangelands to assess land degradation and ii) to inform decisions to promote Sustainable Land Management (SLM) in a way that preserves the diverse ecosystem goods and services provided by rangelands and grasslands. The project has three inter\u2010related components: \n1. Development of a participatory assessment and monitoring system for pastoral areas, comprising of grassland and rangeland. \n2. Inform international and national pastoral decision\u2010making processes based on the results and best practices from the participatory pastoral areas assessments. \n3.
